# Hi, I'm Abbas | Gen AI Engineer & Researcher
**Master’s in Data Analytics @ Clark University | AWS Machine Learning Specialist**

> *Transforming theoretical AI research into scalable, enterprise-grade systems.*

---

### Value-Driven AI Impact
* **High-Throughput Scaling:** Engineering production-grade LLM applications using **Agentic Workflows (LangGraph)** and **vLLM** to bridge research and high-concurrency environments.
* **Impact at Scale:** Slashed inference latency by **30%** and saved **$250K+ annually** by implementing Quantization (AWQ) and custom Hybrid-RAG architectures.
* **Performance Optimization:** Accelerated user time-to-value by **50%** via foundation model fine-tuning (**PEFT/QLoRA**) and sub-second inference pipeline optimization.

---

### Research & "First Principles" Depth
* **IEEE Leadership:** Currently serving as **Research & Innovation Coordinator** for the IEEE Student Branch at Clark University, leading a 5-member team in optimizing Intrusion Detection Systems via hybrid metaheuristic models.
* **From-Scratch Engineering:** To master the mechanics of deep learning, I built a **Deep L-Layer Neural Network from scratch** using only NumPy—focusing on the internal math of backpropagation and optimization.
