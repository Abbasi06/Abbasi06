### 🚀 Value-Driven AI Impact
* **High-Throughput Scaling:** I build professional AI applications using **LangGraph** and **vLLM** to make sure models can handle many users at once.
* **Impact at Scale:** I helped companies save **$250K+ per year** and made AI **30% faster** by using special techniques like Quantization (AWQ).
* **Performance Optimization:** I made apps work **50% faster** for users by fine-tuning models (PEFT/QLoRA) so they respond in less than a second.

### 📂 Featured Architectural Builds

#### [PaperEngine.ai](/PaperEngine.ai) | AI Research Learning Assistant
**The Challenge:** There are too many scientific papers for people to read and summarize manually.  
**The Build:** I built an AI system using **LangGraph** that reads papers, checks its own facts, and answers questions.  
**The Impact:** It made research **50% faster** for teams.

#### [NumPy-From-Scratch](github/Deep-L-Layer-Neural-Network-From-Scratch) | Deep L-Layer Neural Network
**The Challenge:** To truly understand AI, you have to build it from the ground up without using shortcuts.  
**The Build:** I built a deep neural network using **only NumPy** (math library). I coded the math for how the brain of the AI learns.  
**The Impact:** I now deeply understand exactly how AI models work "under the hood."

### 🔬 Current Research Focus
I am the **Research & Innovation Coordinator at IEEE**. I lead a 5-member team using smart math (metaheuristic models) to optimize Intrusion Detection System. We are building better ways to keep internet networks safe.

### 🎮 Behind the Code (Hobbies)
* **Cricket:** When I am not building AI, you will find me on the field playing cricket.
* **Video Games:** I love **Minecraft** and RPG games like **Assassin's Creed**. I think they are masterpieces. I can spend 18 hours straight exploring how their worlds are built.
* **Movies & Series:** I also enjoy watching movies and TV series to relax and unwind.
